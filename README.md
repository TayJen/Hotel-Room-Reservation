# Hotel-room-reservation
## Project Description
To attract customers, the hotel chain has added to its website the ability to book a room without prepayment. However, if the customer cancelled the booking, the company suffered losses. The hotel staff could, for example, buy groceries for the arrival of a guest or simply not have time to find another client.

To solve this problem, we need to develop a system that predicts the rejection of armor. If the model shows that the reservation will be canceled, the client is invited to make a deposit. The deposit amount is 80% of the room rate for one day and the cost of a one-time cleaning. The money will be debited from the client's account if he still cancels the reservation.
